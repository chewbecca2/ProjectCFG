                            Bright Young Women is a compulsive, extraordinary novel inspired by the real-life sorority targeted by America's first celebrity serial killer in his final murderous spree. From Jessica Knoll, author of the New York Times bestseller and #1 Netflix movie Luckiest Girl Alive. January 1978.
                            
                            Tallahassee. When sorority president Pamela Schumacher is startled awake at 3 a.m. by a strange sound, she’s shocked to encounter a scene of implausible violence – two of her friends dead and two others, maimed.
                            
                            Thrust into a terrifying mystery, Pamela becomes entangled in a crime that captivates public interest for more than four decades...
                            
                            On the other side of the country, Tina Cannon has found peace in Seattle after years of hardship. When Ruth, her best friend, goes missing from Lake Sammamish State Park in broad daylight, surrounded by thousands of beachgoers on a beautiful summer day, Tina devotes herself to finding out what happened to her. When Tina hears about the tragedy in Tallahassee, she suspects the same man the papers refer to is responsible.
                            
                            Determined to make him answer for what he did to Ruth, she travels to Florida on a collision course with Pamela – and one last impending tragedy.

One day in Lagos, young dancer Ikemefuna is put on a plane to Houston to meet her new husband, Nna. Promises are made to her - about her education, about the man she will marry, about her freedom.
  
                            None of them are kept. A few months later, self-professed feminist Nna finds a beautiful woman cooking in his parents' kitchen. They tell him Ikemefuna is his wife, there to give them the grandson they've been waiting for.
                            
                            She appears obedient, malleable. But she is no ordinary wife. In the Texas heat, patience runs on short supply and the atmosphere in the house becomes increasingly strained, increasingly violent.
                            
                            Desperation makes people do strange things... Unpredictable and unsettling, HOUSE WOMAN is a delicious thriller you will never be able to forget.

                            Someone's trying to frame me for murder.
                            
                            But I can't prove my innocence. Because then I'd have to confess about... my other husband.
                            
                            Cleo Forsum is a bestselling novelist turned scriptwriter whose TV series, 'The Baking Detective' is a huge success.

                          <p style="width:500px" class="para1">In Millennial Love journalist Olivia Petter explores the questions, quirks and anxieties that consume the contemporary dating landscape. Olivia scrutinises the myths surrounding modern romance and asks why, despite having endless technology designed to aid communication, it's harder to meet someone now than ever before.

                            The book is based on the Independent's chart-topping podcast of the same name and expands on some of the issues discussed on the show, including why contraception is a feminist issue, how dating apps have altered our understanding of attraction, and how 'Love Island' became the unlikely lens through which the consequences of so many of these things were exposed. Other topics covered include read receipt anxiety, why we need to rethink our relationship with porn, and the significance of 'sliding into someone's DMs'. By combining memoir with social commentary and insights from former podcast guests, including Munroe Bergdorf, Elizabeth Day and Lisa Taddeo, Millennial Love is an essential handbook on what it means to love today.

                          <p style="width:500px" class="para2">An urgent, myth-busting book that dismantles sex misinformation and reimagines sexual freedom for today. Clueless about everything from her own anatomy to relationships, Sophia Smith Galer's sex education classes left her with more questions than answers. But what she didn't know was that this lack of knowledge was about to turn her life upside down - as it does to countless people in the UK every year.

                            Thanks to inadequate sex education, many of us are finishing school knowing more about STDs and condoms than the bigger sexual picture - our own physicality, pleasure and consent. And the effects can last a lifetime. In Losing It, Smith Galer shares the eye-opening stories of ordinary people affected by sex misinformation and finds that many of us are unable to access the world of sexual freedom that we've been promised.
                            
                            She draws on her own experiences - and the expertise of a new generation of sex educators - to uncover a world that subscribes to a wide catalogue of sex myths.

                            In these essays, Leila Slimani gives voice to young Moroccan women who are grappling with a conservative Arab culture that at once condemns and commodifies sex. In a country where the law punishes and outlaws all forms of sex outside marriage, as well as homosexuality and prostitution, women have only two options for their sexual identities: virgin or wife.
                            
                            Sex and Lies is an essential confrontation with Morocco's intimate demons and a vibrant appeal for the universal freedom to be, to love and to desire. </p>
